By taking into account localised properties of criminal behaviour, we propose a spatial extension to model-based clustering methods from the mixture modelling literature. The proposed Bayesian model is a finite mixture of Poisson generalised linear models such that each location is probabilistically assigned to one of the clusters. Each cluster is characterised by the regression coefficients which we subsequently use to interpret the localised effects of the covariates. Using a blocking structure of the study region, our approach allows specifying spatial dependence between nearby locations. We estimate the proposed model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and provide a Python implementation.","tags":["spatial statistics","Poisson process","crime model","burglary","spatial heterogeneity","Bayesian mixture model"],"title":"Burglary in London: Insights from Statistical Heterogeneous Spatial Point Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Povala"],"categories":[],"content":"This is a collection of my thoughts on why we have to consider spatial effects when modelling phenomena that occur on a geographical space.
