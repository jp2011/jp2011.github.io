  abstract = {To obtain operational insights regarding the crime of burglary in London, we consider the estimation of the effects of covariates on the intensity of spatial point patterns. Inspired by localised properties of criminal behaviour, we propose a spatial extension to mixtures of generalised linear models from the mixture modelling literature. The proposed Bayesian model is a finite mixture of Poisson generalised linear models such that each location is probabilistically assigned to one of the groups. Each group is characterised by the regression coefficients, which we subsequently use to interpret the localised effects of the covariates. By using a blocks structure of the study region, our approach allows specifying spatial dependence between nearby locations. We estimate the proposed model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and provide a Python implementation.},
