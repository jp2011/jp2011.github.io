This study investigates whether spillover effects can occur in the reporting of domestic abuse by victims. Domestic abuse is a particularly interesting context because of its high prevalence but low reporting rate. Extending existing spatio-temporal Hawkes process specifications, we test for the presence of two spillover channels in all domestic abuse calls in a major English city. We find no evidence to support such effects in the reporting of domestic abuse.","tags":["spatial statistics","Hawkes process","crime model","domestic abuse","spatio-temporal triggering"],"title":"(No) Spillovers in reporting domestic abuse to police","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Povala"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655856000,"objectID":"17c4c5e467479ec549500e7c0e09742f","permalink":"https://jan.povala.com/publication/2022-phd-thesis/","publishdate":"2022-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-phd-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past decades, we have seen an increase in the availability of data that includes spatial information. Incorporating spatial information in models may result in performance improvements, which may then be used to better inform decision-making processes. When modelling spatial data, typical assumptions such as independence of observations across locations, no longer hold. As a consequence, careful methodology is required. This thesis addresses the modelling of two common types of data encountered in spatial modelling: measurements of a quantity at pre-specified locations (e.g., sensor measurements), and events for which geographical location and time are recorded. We develop effective approaches for modelling spatial data in an interpretable manner, thus making it suitable for application domains where the transparency of a model is a desired property. We demonstrate the developed approaches with empirical simulation studies.","tags":["spatial statistics","spatial mixture model","variational Bayes","Bayesian inverse problem"],"title":"Interpretable Models for Spatially Dependent and Heterogeneous Phenomena","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Povala","Ieva Kazlauskaite","Eky Febrianto","Fehmi Cirak","Mark Girolami"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643587200,"objectID":"24e9a7ce3e24f664e53bdc8b8e1698d5","permalink":"https://jan.povala.com/publication/2021_vi_for_bip/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_vi_for_bip/","section":"publication","summary":"Inverse problems involving partial differential equations have shown a great practical use in science and engineering. Although such problems are generally ill-posed, different regularization approaches have been developed to ameliorate this problem. Among them is the Bayesian approach, where a prior probability measure is placed on the quantity of interest. The resulting posterior probability measure is in most cases analytically intractable, and approximation techniques must be used. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been the go-to method for sampling from those posterior measures. This method, although asymptotically exact, is computationally infeasible for large-size problems that often arise in engineering practice.  Variational Bayes (VB) was proposed as a more computationally tractable method for Bayesian inference, approximating a Bayesian posterior distribution with a simpler variational distribution by solving an optimization problem. In this work, we argue, through an extensive empirical assessment, that VB methods are a more flexible, faster, and more scalable alternative to MCMC methods for this class of problems. We propose a natural choice of a family of variational distributions parametrized by precision matrices, thus taking advantage of the sparse structure encoded in the discretization of the problem. We utilize stochastic optimization to efficiently estimate the variational objective and assess not only the expected error in the mean solution but also the ability to quantify the uncertainty of the estimate. We test this on PDEs based on the Poisson equation in 1D and 2D.","tags":["Bayesian inverse problems","variational inference","precision matrix","uncertainty quantification"],"title":"Variational Bayesian Inference using Sparse Matrices for PDE Inverse Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Povala","Seppo Virtanen","Mark Girolami"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596585600,"objectID":"d3af14c0e9ad871c3f765c549eeab682","permalink":"https://jan.povala.com/publication/2020_spatial_poisson_mixtures/","publishdate":"2020-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_spatial_poisson_mixtures/","section":"publication","summary":"To obtain operational insights regarding the crime of burglary in London we consider the estimation of effects of covariates on the intensity of spatial point patterns. By taking into account localised properties of criminal behaviour, we propose a spatial extension to model-based clustering methods from the mixture modelling literature. The proposed Bayesian model is a finite mixture of Poisson generalised linear models such that each location is probabilistically assigned to one of the clusters. Each cluster is characterised by the regression coefficients which we subsequently use to interpret the localised effects of the covariates. Using a blocking structure of the study region, our approach allows specifying spatial dependence between nearby locations. We estimate the proposed model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and provide a Python implementation.","tags":["spatial statistics","Poisson process","crime model","burglary","spatial heterogeneity","Bayesian mixture model"],"title":"Burglary in London: Insights from Statistical Heterogeneous Spatial Point Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Povala"],"categories":[],"content":"This is a collection of my thoughts on why we have to consider spatial effects when modelling phenomena that occur on a geographical space.

This is recognized by the emergence of so-called hot-spots, which are often short-lived. There are a num- ber of theories in criminology that provide an explanation for this, although crime is a complex phenomenon and matching theories with empirical evidence is an ongoing task. Whilst standard regression techniques can be used, the assumptions are typi- cally violated because of spatio-temporal autocorrelation, resulting in poor predictive performance. Recent work has advocated the use of Gaussian process models for their flexibility and tractability, although a Gaussian assumption is only an appropriate approximation in regions of high crime. Instead, a log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) is proposed as a model of criminal activity in space and time. We adopt a Bayesian approach to provide a full quantification of uncertainty. The resulting posterior distri- bution is intractable and poses significant computational challenges that we overcome by the use of Laplace approximation or Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. In either case, by assuming a grid structure, we use Kronecker methods to accelerate the linear algebra procedures involved. We demonstrate the proposed methodology with London crime data for 2016, using socio-economic covariates derived from census data.","tags":["spatial statistics","Poisson process","crime model","burglary"],"title":"Understanding London Crime with Log-Gaussian Cox Processes","type":"publication"}]
